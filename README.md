## Recent Changes


**ver 2.0.0 -- 25jun2023**

* Discontiued OSX development. This makes the package much smaller to deliver.
* Added an autosave function to t4, t5, t6 to restore the previous configuration at startup. It also gives developer a better chance to debug after an abort is reported.
* All puzzles now begin by showing the goal configuration, until the user presses the equal-key.

## Reliquarium Game Description
Reliquarium is a very unique set of 3-Dimensional slider puzzles with a Crystal Skull theme. 
These belong to a new category of puzzle that would be impossible to build or manipulate in physical form. 
They can help improve 3D visualization and problem solving skills. 
Suitable for children preparing for math or geometry, as well as adults. 
Works on laptops or PCs running Windows or Linux.

=========================================================

## Introduction
A reckless raider from Indiana has been plundering tombs and displacing ancient relics.  The objective here is to return each relic to its proper place at the center of its cubical box by rearranging the framework back into its original configuration.  Colors and numerals help determine the proper order.

Note that the X, Y, & Z axes are shown by default. 

In "standard" position...

* +X is rightward
* +Y is upward
* +Z points forward, toward the viewer

Dragging the cursor with the LEFT mouse button rotates the puzzle for a better view angle.  The keys n/a (Nearer/Away) or the mouse wheel zooms.  

Typing a number selects a piece to move.  
Alternatively, you can select a piece by RIGHT-clicking the cursor on it, prior to the move.

Then use the keys {u,d,l,r,f,b} to move the selected piece (Up,Down,Left,Right,Forward,Backward).

To make the puzzles much more challenging, you can toggle the numerals off with the n-key. Of course that means you will need to use the right mouse button to select the piece you want to move.

As indicated on screen, (h) will toggle a help screen.

These puzzles are easy enough for children but will likely help anyone improve their 3D visualization, geometry, problem solving and computer skills.

There are 4 variations numbered 2, 4, 5, and 6.  Puzzles # 4, 5, & 6 are my own creations, where the numeral represents the vertical size;  while #2 is a well-known Grabarchuk puzzle.  Generally, the puzzles with a smaller number are more difficult.  Puzzle #4 is the most compact & difficult.


## General Strategy
Temporarily combine complementary pieces to maximize contiguous empty swap space.


## Game Features
* Works on PCs or laptops running Windows or GNU/Linux.  And if Ada is installed you can build it yourself!  But first try the delivered, prebuilt binaries.

* Windows & Linux binaries provided, as well as full source.

* Laptop friendly controls;  supports High DPI displays.



## Mouse/touchpad/keyboard controls

Look direction is controlled by a touch pad swipe or mouse drag;

Movement is controlled by the keys:  
	u d l r f b  (Up Down Left Right Forward Backward)

In other words...

*	forward/backward : moves selected block in Z direction
*	right/left       : moves selected block in X-direction
*	up/down          : moves selected block in Y-direction

This terminology for key-assignments assumes 

* X+ is rightward, 
* Y+ is upward, and 
* Z+ is outward...

the standard "view" for geometrical discussions in mathematics and physics.  Note that the X, Y, & Z Axes are displayed by default.

Obviously this gets confusing after you rotate the figure to get a better look. That is part of the challenge!

Keys active:

* (esc)-key => Exit puzzle
* (q)-key => Exit selection screen
* (mouseWheel) => Zoom
* (i)/(o)-keys => Zoom In/Out
* (spc)-key => Restart
* (c)-key => nextSkinColor
* (n)-key => toggle Numerals
* (h)-key => Help toggle
* 0-9 => select numbered block
* (s)-key => select Skull
* (m)-key => select Medusa head
* (v)-key => toggle move-sounds

Main Movement Keys: Arrows, Letters

* (up)-key, (u)-key => +Y
* (dn)-key, (d)-key => -Y
* (lf)-key, (l)-key => -X
* (rt)-key, (r)-key => +X

* (f)-key => +Z
* (b)-key => -Z

--------------------------------------------------------------
Cursor click:  selects the piece that the user wishes to move. This selection persists until another is made.

But note that once a move direction is chosen:

* if no selection is made then an autoselct feature will choose a piece that can move, if possible.
* if the selected piece cannot move, the autoselect will try to find another that can.

Thusly, if there is only one piece that can move in a given direction, you need not bother to select it before the move.

------------------------------------------------------------


## Required for running:

* graphics card & updated driver that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;
* Windows, GNU/Linux;


## Setup and Running Reliquarium:

Windows users should read "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this.

Open a command line terminal, then cd to the install directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type "winreliq.bat" 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users type "gnureliq.sh" to start the game.
In Linux, you may also double click the icon for reliquarium in the file manager.

Another option, however is that linux users can probably run the Windows executables under "wine". Here are two examples that work on my linux machine:

		wine bin/win/reliquarium.exe

		wine bin/win/tomb6.exe

Thusly, each executable can be called directly, skipping the selection screen. Without wine that would be:

		bin/gnu/tomb6

Windows users: DO NOT try running the linux executables under WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux]; that mode is not supported. Simply use the windows version.


**If an older Linux system complains that /dev/dsp/ cannot be opened, prepend the command with "padsp",EG:  "padsp (ExeName)".**



--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Select which of the four tombs to open by clicking on it.
* When ready to begin, hit the (=)-key.
* Hit the (esc)-key at any time to return to the selector app;  
* Hit (q)-key to quit completely.

Hint: if the move sound goes silent, you probably hit the "v" key by mistake.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Open Source libraries included for rebuilding:
* systems:  Windows or GNU/Linux
* a recent Ada compiler;  eg. GNU-Ada...try this source:
	https://github.com/alire-project/GNAT-FSF-builds/releases

* the ./adabindings/ directory contains Ada interfaces for:
	* gl
	* glfw
	* OpenAL
	* Stephen Sanguine's AdaPngLib
	* Dmitriy Anisimkov's Zlib for Ada
	* Felix Krause's FreeTypeAda



## Build instructions:

Two [pre-compiled] binary executables are provided, one for Windows & one for gnu/linux.

Build scripts for GNU Ada [with its own g++] are provided. 

-------------------------------------------------------
msWin64 => setpath64.bat + wbuildAll.bat

Windows users please read gnuAdaOnWindows.txt


------------------------------------------------------
GNU/Linux => lbuildAll.sh (GNU Ada)

utilizes the uncommon relocatable libraries (mainly GLFW) that are delivered in this bundle under ./libs/.  This is used to build a dynamically linked [gnu/linux] executable, which should run in the presence of ./libs, whether or not your system has those libraries installed.





## What is special about this project?
It uses the Ada programming language and modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Compiles and runs on Windows & GNU/Linux systems.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine & Dimitry Anisimkov, OpenAL-Audio with a homebrew binding, and an Ada compiler.

Written in C++ style, the code neglects many safety features available to Ada, but it does serve as a working example for learning OpenGL.  The Ada bindings used are thin, so the relationship to C++ methodology is transparent.  Developers should note that these Ada bindings are usable as a standalone library for most any OpenGL project that uses Ada.

Thus, for the C++ programmer the code should be easy to comprehend; and for the experienced Ada programmer there are many potential improvements to be made.  

Open source Ada developers are welcome to help improve or extend this app.
Developer or not, send comments, suggestions or questions to:

and please include the file "t#restore.txt" if you are reporting a freeze or abort,
where "#" is 4/5/6.
