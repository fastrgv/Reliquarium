## Reliquarium Game Description
Reliquarium is a very unique set of four 3D slider puzzles, all with a Crystal Skull theme.  Works on Macs running OSX and PCs running Windows or GNU/Linux.

A reckless raider from Indiana has been plundering tombs and displacing ancient relics.  The objective is to carefully return each relic to its rightful place at the center of its cubical box by rearranging the numbered blocks back into their proper order.  Colors and numerals help determine the proper order.

Dragging the cursor rotates the cube for a better view angle.  The keys n/a (Nearer/Away) or the mouse wheel zooms.  Typing a number selects a block to move.  Then use the keys {u,d,l,r,f,b} to move the selected block (Up,Down,Left,Right,Forward,Backward).

Alternatively, you can select a block by clicking the cursor on it, prior to the move.

As indicated on screen, (h) will toggle a help screen.

These puzzles are easy enough for children but will likely help anyone improve their 3D visualization, geometry, problem solving and computer skills.

There are 4 variations numbered 2, 4, 5, and 6.  Puzzles # 4, 5, & 6 are my own creations, where the numeral represents the vertical size;  while #2 is a well-known [2D] Grabarchuk puzzle.  Generally, the puzzles with a smaller number are somewhat more difficult.  Puzzle #4 is the most compact & difficult.


## General Strategy
Temporarily combine complementary pieces to maximize contiguous empty swap space.


## Game Features
* Works on PCs or laptops running Windows, OSX or GNU/Linux.  And if GNAT is installed you can build it yourself!  But first try the delivered, prebuilt binaries.

* Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX binaries provided, as well as full source.

* Laptop friendly controls;  supports Mac Retina displays.



## Mouse/touchpad/keyboard controls

Look direction is controlled by a touch pad swipe or mouse drag;

Movement is controlled by the keys:  
	u d l r f b  (Up Down Left Right Forward Backward)

In other words...

*	forward/backward : moves selected block in Z direction
*	right/left       : moves selected block in X-direction
*	up/down          : moves selected block in Y-direction

This terminology for key-assignments assumes X+ is rightward, Y+ is upward, and Z+ is outward...the standard "view" for geometrical discussions in mathematics and physics.  Note that the X, Y, & Z Axes are displayed by default.

Obviously this might get confusing if you rotate the figure to get a better look. That is part of the challenge!

Other keys active:

* (esc)-key => Exit puzzle
* (q)-key => Exit selection screen
* (mouseWheel) => Zoom
* (i)/(o)-keys => Zoom In/Out
* (spc)-key => Restart
* (c)-key => nextSkinColor
* (h)-key => Help toggle
* 0-9 => select numbered block
* (s)-key => select Skull
* (m)-key => select Medusa head
* (v)-key => toggle move-sounds

------------------------------------------------------------


## Required for running:

* graphics card & updated driver that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;
* Windows, GNU/Linux or OSX>=10.13(sep2017);


## Setup and Running Reliquarium:

Windows users should read "windows-setup.txt".
Mac users see "osx-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this.  The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

On OSX, you can use Keka.

Open a command line terminal, then cd to the install directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type "winreliq.bat".

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users type "gnureliq.sh" to start the game.
In Linux, you may also double click the icon for reliquarium in the file manager.

The distributed linux executables require glibc v2.14 or newer.  That means if your distribution is older, it might not run, and you will need to recompile. Another option, however is that linux users can probably run the Windows executables under "wine". Here is an example that works on my linux machine:

		wine bin/win/tomb6.exe

Thusly, each executable can be called directly, skipping the selection screen. Without wine that would be:

		bin/gnu/tomb6

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mac command line version is initiated by opening a terminal, navigating to the install_directory, and typing "macreliq.sh" on the command line.

Also, for Mac users, there is a Mac bundle (named "reliquarium.app") that acts like a typical Mac app.  You can put it into your personal Applications directory with the command "cp -r reliquarium.app ~/Applications".  You can navigate to the installation directory in Finder and click the reliquarium.app icon named "Reliquarium".


Select which of the four tombs to open by clicking on it.  Hit the (esc)-key at any time to return to the selector app;  hit (q)-key to quit completely.

Hint: if the move sound goes silent, you probably hit the "v" key by mistake.

## Open Source libraries included for rebuilding:
* systems:  Windows, OSX or GNU/Linux
* a recent gnat compiler
* the ./adabindings/ directory contains Ada interfaces for:
	* AdaPngLib
	* gl
	* glfw
	* FreeType
	* OpenAL (Windows)



## Build instructions:

Three [pre-compiled] binary executables are provided, one for Windows, one for gnu/linux and one for OSX.  The linux version, reliquarium, is intended to run in the presence of the directory "libs", which contains some dynamically loaded libraries that can be, but need not be present on a target system:
GLFW2, & freetype.

Build scripts for the free AdaCore GNAT compiler are provided;  a Windows or linux build machine need not have a C++ compiler installed.  Only GNAT is required.

-------------------------------------------------------
msWin32 => wbuildAll.bat

Note that the 64-bit AdaCore gnat compiler needs to be on your path to use this script.

-------------------------------------------------------
MacOSX => obuildAll.sh:

build script for generating a portable executable that will run on most OSX platforms whether or not they have non-standard libraries installed.  Any Mac with a recent but standard configuration of OSX should be able to rebuild using this script.  Here, all nonstandard libraries are included under the ./libs/ directory and are statically linked.

------------------------------------------------------
GNU/Linux => lbuildAll.sh

utilizes the uncommon relocatable libraries (mainly GLFW) that are delivered in this bundle under ./libs/.  This is used to build a dynamically linked [gnu/linux] executable, which should run in the presence of ./libs, whether or not your system has those libraries installed.



### Link Problems during linux build:

On a linux build machine, you might have minor link errors, depending on its configuration.  For example, if you are missing "libz", you can copy "libz.so" from the AdaCore ~/lib/ directory into /usr/local/lib/.  If "libGL" cannot be found, this literally means "libGL.so" was absent.  But you might have "libGL.so.1" present.  In this case, simply create a softlink by changing to the libGL directory, then type the line:

sudo ln -s libGL.so.1 libGL.so  (and enter the admin password)

whence the linker should now be able to find what it wants.  But if there is more than one file libGL present on your system, make sure you use the best one;  i.e. the one that uses your accelerated-graphic-driver.



## What is special about this project?
It uses the Ada programming language and modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Compiles and runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OSX systems.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine & Dimitry Anisimkov, OpenAL-Audio with a homebrew binding, and a GNAT compiler.

Written in C++ style, the code neglects many safety features available to Ada, but it does serve as a working example for learning OpenGL.  The Ada bindings used are thin, so the relationship to C++ methodology is transparent.  Developers should note that these Ada bindings are usable as a standalone library for most any OpenGL project that uses Ada.

Thus, for the C++ programmer the code should be easy to comprehend; and for the experienced Ada programmer there are many potential improvements to be made.  Suggestions or improvements from Ada developers are welcomed.
